Absolutely—let’s lock down a clear, testable design first. We’ll build the EA in modular layers, include on-chart visuals and rich logging for easier verification, and make breakeven+profit logic configurable for both same-direction baskets and opposite-direction netting. Below is a structured design you can review and adjust before we write code.

Design goals
- Adaptive grid that works in both ranging and trending regimes
- Multi-indicator coherence: require several signals within N bars (or a weighted score) before acting
- Auto re-centering of the grid based on VWAP, ZigZag mid, or both
- Basket management that supports:
  - Same-direction breakeven+profit closure (per side, configurable)
  - Opposite-direction breakeven+profit (net across both sides)
  - Same-direction basket TP and per-order TP/SL
  - Priority policy: breakeven-first optional, with regime-based overrides
- Strong observability: on-chart visualization + structured logging/CSV for testing
- Broker compatibility considerations (hedging vs netting accounts)

Architecture overview
- Modules
  - Indicator Engine:
    - ZigZag (range context)
    - VWAP (day/session anchored) with slope and distance metrics
    - Squeeze detector (BB vs KC), optional TTM Squeeze via iCustom
    - Optional trend filters: EMA slope/stack, ADX, Supertrend, Donchian bias, RSI trend, Ichimoku baseline/kijun angle (toggles)
    - Optional range filters: ATR bandwidth, Fractal width, Donchian channel width, Bollinger bandwidth
  - Signal Aggregator:
    - Coherence window: all required conditions within N bars OR weighted scoring with threshold
    - Direction resolution: +1 up, -1 down, 0 neutral
    - Regime classification: Range-only, Trend-only, or Auto
  - Grid Engine:
    - Center selector: VWAP, ZigZagMid, or Blend
    - Placement mode: LimitsOnly (range), StopsTrend (breakout/trend), BothEntries
    - Dynamic step sizing: ATR-based with min/max constraints
    - Levels per side, lot sizing (fixed/geometric/volatility-scaled), max orders
    - Re-centering triggers: drift threshold, flat position, periodic, or indicator event
  - Basket Manager:
    - Per-side basket P/L tracking (buys and sells) and net P/L
    - Same-direction breakeven+profit thresholds (separate for long/short)
    - Opposite-direction net breakeven+profit target
    - Same-direction basket TP, per-order TP/SL, optional trailing baskets
    - Priority policy engine (breakeven-first toggle, regime override)
  - Risk Manager:
    - Equity DD stop, margin safety, spread/volatility filters, max lots/orders, news blackout
  - UI & Logging:
    - On-chart overlays: grid levels, centerlines, regime/signal badges, squeeze state, VWAP slope arrow, basket P/L badges
    - Control panel (buttons): Pause/Resume, Flatten, Recenter Now, Toggle Visuals
    - Structured logs: Experts log and CSV/JSON lines for Strategy Tester auditability

Trading logic (high level)
- Regime selection
  - Range-only: place buy/sell limit grids around center; both directions open
  - Trend-only: place stop orders in trend direction or pullback limits on trend side only
  - Auto: use Squeeze release direction + VWAP slope + optional filters to bias trend; otherwise range behavior
- Entries
  - Require coherence: signals aligned within SignalWindowBars or reach a SignalScore >= threshold
  - Constrain entries by MaxSpread, MaxOrders, and volatility guards
- Exits (priorities)
  - If PriorityBreakevenFirst: check breakeven+profit closures first
    - Opposite-direction net breakeven+profit (NetCloseMinProfitMoney)
    - Same-direction breakeven+profit per side (LongBreakevenMinProfit, ShortBreakevenMinProfit)
  - Then same-direction basket TP per side (BasketTPMoneyLong/BasketTPMoneyShort)
  - Then per-order TP/SL
  - Safety/force exits: equity DD stop, time-based flatten, news window
- Re-centering
  - Update center when:
    - Price drift from current center > RecenterThresholdPips
    - Flat and RecenterOnFlatClose
    - Periodic schedule (e.g., every X minutes)
    - Squeeze release event (optional tick box)

Indicators and coherence
- Trend filters (toggleable)
  - VWAP: price relative to VWAP + slope magnitude threshold
  - EMA stack: e.g., EMA20 > EMA50 > EMA100 for uptrend; use slopes
  - ADX: ADX > threshold confirms trend; DI+/DI- for direction
  - Supertrend direction
  - Donchian: price above mid or upper channel bias
- Range filters (toggleable)
  - ATR band narrowness: ATR/N-bars below threshold
  - Bollinger bandwidth below threshold
  - Donchian channel width below threshold
  - ZigZag last swing height/width within range limits
- Squeeze
  - BB width < KC width = squeeze on; release detected on transition
  - Direction inference: price vs VWAP and VWAP slope (or TTM Squeeze histogram if available via iCustom)
- Coherence strategies
  - Strict: all selected conditions must be true within SignalWindowBars
  - Weighted scoring: each indicator contributes a score; act if score >= threshold

Grid mechanics
- Center modes
  - VWAP (day or session anchored)
  - ZigZagMid (last confirmed swing high/low midpoint)
  - Blend (weighted VWAP and ZigZagMid)
- Step size
  - Fixed pips OR ATR-based: Step = max(MinStep, min(MaxStep, ATRMult * ATR))
- Placement
  - LevelsPerSide per direction
  - EntryMode:
    - LimitsOnly: grid below center for buys, above center for sells (range)
    - StopsTrend: grid above center for buys, below center for sells (breakout)
    - BothEntries: interleaved limits/stops
- Lot sizing
  - Fixed
  - Multiplier (geometric)
  - Volatility-scaled (reduce size as ATR rises, optional hard caps)

Basket and closure policies
- Same-direction basket management (per side)
  - Parameters:
    - BasketTPMoneyLong, BasketTPMoneyShort
    - BasketBreakevenMinProfitLong, BasketBreakevenMinProfitShort
    - BasketTrailLockMoneyLong/Short (optional)
  - Behavior: when side P/L reaches breakeven+profit threshold, close that side; similarly for TP
- Opposite-direction net close
  - Parameter: NetCloseMinProfitMoney (as in your note)
  - Behavior: close all buys and sells when total net P/L exceeds target
- Priority and overrides
  - PriorityBreakevenFirst (global)
  - Regime-level overrides:
    - In strong trend, allow trend-side basket to seek BasketTP before net breakeven close
    - In range, prioritize breakeven to flatten exposure aggressively
- Per-order
  - Optional PerOrderTPPips/PerOrderSLPips
  - Optional time-based expiry for pendings

Risk management
- EquityStopPct
- MaxOrders, MaxLots, MaxLotsPerSide
- MarginSafetyPct (flatten when free margin < threshold)
- Spread filter, VolatilityHalt when ATR spike > threshold
- News blackout windows (manual schedule at first; optional integration later)

Visualization plan (ease of testing)

  - Center lines: VWAP (gold), ZigZagMid (purple), Blend (white)
  - Grid levels: buy levels (green), sell levels (red); different styles for limits vs stops
  - Squeeze status badge: On (yellow), Released Up (blue), Released Down (magenta)
  - VWAP slope arrow/text, regime label, coherence score/flags
  - Basket P/L labels near price or in a corner panel
  - Entry/exit arrows with tooltips (ticket, lots, reason)
- Control panel buttons
  - Pause/Resume entries
  - Flatten all
  - Recenter now
  - Toggle visuals/logging verbosity

State machine
- States: Paused, Idle, GridPlaced, Managing, Flattening
- Events: NewBar, SqueezeRelease, DriftExceeded, BasketHitBE, BasketHitTP, EquityStop, NewsWindow
- Transitions:
  - Idle -> GridPlaced when signals coherent and risk OK
  - Managing -> Flattening on any exit condition
  - Flattening -> Idle when flat and optional re-center

Coherence and decision pseudocode
- Direction and regime resolution:
  - condUp = TrendFilterUp AND (SqueezeReleasedUp OR TrendFiltersVoteUp >= threshold)
  - condDn = TrendFilterDn AND (SqueezeReleasedDn OR TrendFiltersVoteDn >= threshold)
  - if RegimeMode == TrendOnly: dir = condUp ? +1 : condDn ? -1 : 0
  - if RegimeMode == RangeOnly: dir = 0
  - if RegimeMode == Auto:
    - if condUp XOR condDn: dir = corresponding
    - else dir = 0 (range behavior)
- Entry allowed if all required signals within SignalWindowBars (strict) or score >= SignalScoreThreshold

Exit priority guidance
- Default recommendation: prioritize breakeven closures to reduce exposure
  - In trend, consider RegimeOverrideBreakevenFirst=Disable to let the trend basket reach BasketTP first
- Both same-direction and opposite-direction closures should support breakeven+profit thresholds, each independently configurable

Testing plan
- Backtest scenarios (M5–H1) across:
  - Range day: tight daily ATR, frequent BE closures
  - Trend day up/down: strong VWAP slope, trend-only entries
  - Squeeze release: entries biased by release direction, check re-center triggers
  - Parameter sweeps: StepMode Fixed vs ATR, LevelsPerSide variations
  - Stress: high spread, ATR spike, margin pressure, equity DD stop
- Verify via:
  - On-chart overlays and panel statuses (center lines, grid, labels)
  - CSV logs (every decision, indicator values, P/L and closures)
  - Cross-check basket P/L math with Strategy Tester results

Milestones
- M1: Skeleton EA with parameters, indicator reads, signal aggregator (strict mode), fixed-step grid, basic logging
- M2: Basket manager with all closure modes, priority policy, on-chart P/L labels
- M3: Visualization overlays and control panel; CSV logging
- M4: ATR-based step, additional trend/range indicators, coherence scoring
- M5: Risk extensions, news filter, periodic re-center; refinements and optimizations

Clarifications to proceed
- Which additional indicators do you want first (EMA stack, ADX, Supertrend, Donchian, RSI, Ichimoku)?
- Preferred VWAP anchor (daily midnight server time vs specific session)?
- Default timeframe(s) and symbols?
- Lot sizing preference (fixed vs multiplier vs volatility-scaled)?
- Hedging availability on your account (needed for opposite-direction baskets)?
- Acceptable max drawdown and target win rate to guide default thresholds?

If you confirm this design (or note changes), I’ll implement Milestone M1 with the visuals and logging foundations so testing is straightforward from day one.
